--IMPORTANT--
1. Update all effects to attach to projectiles rather than reading from the bow.
2. Add % of Piercing on piercing stats print-out.
3. Add parser for effects, as well as commands when they're added.

--EFFECTS BY TXT FILE--
Update plugin to read from text files. This will be used to read from files based on item names.
I.E. The item name could be 'Holy Sword' and that would read from the 'Holy_Sword.txt' file.
This would also be used to read effects from players. This would be used majorly for patreon effects. This would allow players to
use a command such as /effect <effect> that would then apply the effects on any bow they use rather than reading from the bow itself.
It would read from a file such as "Player_'username'.txt" then read from the '<effect>' section.
I.E.
Player_KipperOrigin.txt
Firewheel
Desc: Fire particles spawn in a circle around the arrow.
Effects:
  - effect command line here.
  - another effect command line.
  - etc.
  
* This will eventually be used for effects outside of bow particle effects, but the initial version will most likely only include bows.
* Future versions will be planned to have effect types, and subtypes. I.E. Type: Bow, Subtype: Firework/Particle
  
Commands would be as such
/effect list (gives the player a list of effects they can use)
/effect off (disables current effect)
/effect <effect> (enables effect to play. Overrides effect of same type)
/effect info <effect> (gives player detailed information on the effect; if a player does not have the effect, the unlock information will also print out)
/effect list <type> (gives player a list of effects based on the type)
/effect types (gives players the types of effects)

Flags for commands
-all (only used for lists, this would show players all effects including effects they don't have)

Admin Commands
/effect remove <effect> <line #>
/effect add <effect>
/effect overwrite <effect> <line #>
/effect create <effect> <type> <description>
